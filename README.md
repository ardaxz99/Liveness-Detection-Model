This project is completed as a METU EEESTAR project in 2020-2021.  
This code trains and implements liveness detection with video input.  
The VGG19 model is trained with ROSE-Youtu Face Liveness Detection Dataset.  
The extra information regarding the dataset can be found at:  
https://rose1.ntu.edu.sg/dataset/faceLivenessDetection/  
All codes and related files can be found under master branch.  
You can use gather examples.py file to extract face images from videos and train your model with train.py .  
Use liveness_demo.py file to see the implementaion of liveness detection model in real time.
